= Introduction
Welcome to the *Data Structures* lab. This document contains all the necessary
code snippets and instructions.

== Learning Outcomes
1. Understand Arrays
2. Implement Linked Lists
3. Master Binary Trees

#note[
  Make sure you have the C++ compiler installed on your system before proceeding
  with the examples.
]

== Code Example
Here is the boilerplate code for today's lab:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello ITU!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#warning[ Do not copy-paste code blindly. Try to understand the logic first! ]

= Linked Lists
